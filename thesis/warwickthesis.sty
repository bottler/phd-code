%%% This file is free and can be modified or distributed as long as
%%% you meet the following conditions:

%%% (1) This copyright notice is kept intact on all modified copies.
%%% (2) If you modify this file, you MUST NOT use the original file name.
%%%
%%% This file defines macros used for preparing theses for
%%% The University of Texas at Austin.  It has been tested with LaTeX2e.
%%% I do NOT guarantee that it will meet all requirements of the
%%% Graduate School; however,
%! neither do I, but I am fairly confident because the university
%regulations are almost minimal.
%! if you find that something violates the
%! specifications, please send me email at <m.j.hadley@warwick.ac.uk>
%! I will try to fix it.
%%%
%%% Usage:
%%% ======
%%%
%%% To use this file with LaTeX2e, make sure your TEXINPUTS environment
%%% variable contains the directory in which this file is located.
%%% Include this file as a package in the preamble:
%%%
%%% \documentclass[...]{report}
%!   \usepackage{wnewthesis}
%%%
%%% On non-UNIX systems, there might be different environment variables
%%% that might need to be set.  I know nothing about such machines,
%%% however; consult your local guru for details.
%%%
%%% A template for a thesis is provided in the file
%!   warwickthesis.tex, available
%%% from the same place where you obtained this file.
%%%
%%% Command Names:
%%% ==============
%%%
%%% ALL command names used in this file that are used to format the
%%% thesis begin with "thesis" (e.g., \thesisauthor).  All of these
%%% commands can be changed by the user using \renewcommand, e.g.,
%%%
%%% \renewcommand{\thesisauthor}{First M. Last}
%%%
%%% after loading the package in LaTeX2e.

%%%                  %% required by the Graduate School is \oneandhalfspace,
%%%                  %% but \singlespace is useful, e.g., when using

Unless otherwise indicated (see 2.3 below) this will be made openly accessible on the Internet and will be supplied to the British Library to be made available online via its Electronic Theses Online Service (EThOS) service.
[At present, theses submitted for a Master's degree by Research (MA, MSc, LLM, MS or MMedSci) are not being deposited in WRAP and not being made available via EthOS. This may change in future.]
      \item In exceptional circumstances, the Chair of the Board of Graduate Studies may grant permission for an embargo to be placed on public access to the hard copy thesis for a limited period.

Rights granted to the University of Warwick and the British Library and the user of the thesis through this
agreement are non-exclusive. I retain all rights in the thesis in its present version or future versions. I
agree that the institutional repository administrators and the British Library or their agents may, without
changing content, digitise and migrate the thesis to any medium or format for the purpose of future
preservation and accessibility.

  \item  \textbf{ DECLARATIONS}
\begin{enumerate} 
       \item I DECLARE THAT:
\begin{itemize}
\item I am the author and owner of the copyright in the thesis and/or I have the authority of the
authors and owners of the copyright in the thesis to make this agreement. Reproduction
of any part of this thesis for teaching or in academic or other forms of publication is
subject to the normal limitations on the use of copyrighted materials and to the proper and
full acknowledgement of its source.
\item The digital version of the thesis I am supplying is the same version as the final, hardbound
copy submitted in completion of my degree, once any minor corrections have been
completed.
\item I have exercised reasonable care to ensure that the thesis is original, and does not to the
best of my knowledge break any UK law or other Intellectual Property Right, or contain
any confidential material.
\item I understand that, through the medium of the Internet, files will be available to automated
agents, and may be searched and copied by, for example, text mining and plagiarism
detection software.
\end{itemize}

     \item IF I HAVE AGREED (in Section 2 above) TO MAKE MY THESIS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE
DIGITALLY, I ALSO DECLARE THAT:
\begin{itemize}
\item I grant the University of Warwick and the British Library a licence to make available on the
Internet the thesis in digitised format through the Institutional Repository and through the
British Library via the EThOS service.
\item If my thesis does include any substantial subsidiary material owned by third-party
copyright holders, I have sought and obtained permission to include it in any version of
my thesis available in digital format and that this permission encompasses the rights that I
have granted to the University of Warwick and to the British Library.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{ LEGAL INFRINGEMENTS}\\
I understand that neither the University of Warwick nor the British Library have any obligation to take legal
action on behalf of myself, or other rights holders, in the event of infringement of intellectual property
rights, breach of contract or of any other right, in the thesis.
