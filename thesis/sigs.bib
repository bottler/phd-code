abstract={Writer identification plays a significant role in several applications including forensic trace evidence identification, mobile bank transaction authentication, and handwritten character/text recognition. However, performing writer identification requires a considerable amount of experimental work and labor, as well as professional skills. In this paper, we propose a novel path-signature long short-term memory (PS-LSTM) recurrent neural network for writer identification that contributes as follows: 1) A mathematical feature set, path signature, is successfully applied to writer identification to characterize the essential geometric and analytic properties of pen-tip trajectory, which help distinguish between the diverse writing styles of different people, especially in confusing situations. 2) Different iterated integrals of path signature are investigated to model the local curvature nature of the pen-tip trajectory for writer identification. 3) Our study is the first to demonstrate the significance of integrating path signature with long short-term memory for writer identification. On Database CASIA-OLHWDN1.0, the proposed PS-LSTM writer identification achieves significantly superior results and outperforms previous works.},

	%abstract="Beginning around 1963 with the paper of Hermann [1] there began to be developed a theory of controllability that included nonlinear effects in a mathematically natural way. By the early 1970's this work was in full swing, with several centers of activity throughout the world. In addition to the study of thermodynamic paths, which were the inspiration for the earlier work of Caratheodory and Chow, a number of other physical problems began to be studied using these techniques. Among these were a set of questions concerning the control of rigid bodies. Some of these are mentioned in reference [2] and several others, including the development of necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability of the Euler equations in body fixed, angular velocity space, were discussed in [3] [4] [5]. One could characterize the bulk of this work as being nonconstructive in the sense that the authors gave sufficient conditions for the existence of a control which steered the state from one point to another but did not give a procedure for computing such a control.",

%abstract = "The Chen-Fliess series is known to be an exponential Lie series. Previously explicit formulas for the iterated integral coefficients were known only for its factorization into a directed infinite product of exponentials. This factorization uses Hall sets and the Zinbiel product. We use the underlying Hopf algebra structure to derive explicit formulas for the corresponding coefficients in the logarithm of the series. This allows one to express the series as a single exponential. This work is closely related to Fer and Magnus expansions, and has interpretations in terms of a continuous Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula. The result facilitates work in nonlinear control, numerical integration and various applications that involve compositions of noncommuting flows.",

%abstract="There is a notion of ``non-commutative Lie algebra'' called Leibniz algebra, which is characterized by the following property. The bracketing [-, z] is a derivation for the bracket operation, that is, it satisfies the Leibniz identity: {\$}{\$}{\backslash}left[ {\{}{\backslash}left[ {\{}x,y{\}} {\backslash}right],z{\}} {\backslash}right] = {\backslash}left[ {\{}{\backslash}left[ {\{}x,z{\}} {\backslash}right],y{\}} {\backslash}right] + {\backslash}left[ {\{}x,{\backslash}left[ {\{}y,z{\}} {\backslash}right]{\}} {\backslash}right]{\$}{\$}cf.

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}
