%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).

The iterated-integral signature, or rough-path signature, of a path has proved useful in several machine learning applications in the last few years. This work is extended in a number of ways. Algorithms for computing the signature and log signature efficiently are investigated and evaluated, which is useful for many applications of signatures when working with large datasets. Online Chinese character recognition using signature features with recurrent neural networks is investigated. A recurrent neural network cell which stores its memory as the signature of a path is suggested and demonstrated on a toy problem. 

There is an essentially unique element of the signature of a path in space which, under transformations of the space, scales with volume. That element is characterised geometrically.

Given two features of curves, you can make a new one by taking the signed area of the 2d curve those two features make as a curve is traced out. A simple algebraic description of those features (which turn out to be signature elements) which can be formed from linear combinations of such combinations of total displacements is conjectured and worked towards. This is know as ``areas of areas''.

\section*{Notation}
When dealing with the tensor algebra and related concerns I often choose to adopt the notation of \cite{FLA}.

There are a couple competing claims for the use of the $\otimes$ symbol in a work such as this, because we are dealing with the tensor algebra. % and numerics based on it.
Besides when introducing the tensor algebra in 
%TODO
the symbol $\otimes$ is never used to indicate the product, otherwise known as the concatenation product, within the tensor algebra. It generally means the external tensor product, which produces (elements of) tensor powers of the tensor algebra. This is consistent with \cite{FLA}. But our $\otimes$ is what \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_algebra} calls $\boxtimes$.
%In section \ref{sec:backprop}, the symbol has a concrete meaning as the kronecker product of vectors of numbers. - no we underline it there for clarity
\fi%notation section

\section*{Where is the code?}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Where is the code?}
There has, naturally, been a lot of computer code involved in this project.
The good algorithms for signature and log signature calculations in \autoref{chap:iisig} have been released as part of the Python library \ii, whose homepage is at \url{github.com/bottler/iisignature}. 
From there, it should be easy to find its documentation and tests. Some associated tools etc.~are in the \verb|examples| subfolder.
Several other parts of this project have companion code in repositories of \url{github.com/bottler}, for example at \url{https://github.com/bottler/phd-code} and \url{https://github.com/bottler/free-lie-algebra-py}.
