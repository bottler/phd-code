Some experiments and other code from my PhD work at Warwick supervised by Dr Ben Graham and Dr Anastasia Papavasiliou.

Much of the most useful and important code is in specific repositories elsewhere, for example `iisignature`, `free-lie-algebra-py`, and `PythonMisc`.

The folder `thesis` contains much the tex source of my final thesis.
